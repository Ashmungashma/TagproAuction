<template name="frontpage">

    <!-- I think we need a landing page template that has a sign in button & a sign up button

         Once signed in, it'll have a grid of links.

         If normal player, "View Teams", "Draft", "Edit Profile".
         If captain, all above and "Manage Team", "Trade", "Waivers".
         If Admin, normal player + "Approve Trades".

         Ideally, the auction page will be the only one with per-role smaller templates.
         Everything else "restricted" will have a top-level check to see if you're a captain or admin and let it go.
